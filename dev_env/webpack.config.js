/*
    Should contain a basic webpack config which uses entry.js as an entry point and bundles all together
    using Babel and bundles all into /dist, static assets such as *.less and *.jpg should be exported as well

    At the end use uglify to minify bundle with webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin()

    Plug eslint-loader in to the mix and see some coding errors!
