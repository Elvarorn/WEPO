Header should only contain an empty <nav></nav> at first. CounterWrapper should contain a <div class=\"container\"></div> and render this.props.children. Counter should be a stateful component which has a single state property called _counter_ which should be initialized as 0. It also should contain a <p></p> which renders the state _counter_ and a button which increments the state property by 1, each time it is pressed.",
